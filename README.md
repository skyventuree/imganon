# What's ImgAnon?
ImgAnon is an re-implentation of Online Image hosting. This project is for the purpose of practicing.

# Before using this:
I highly against using this tool for public use as it lacks a lot of security features and I'm not willing to fix any of them. Please do not consider making a pull request (if this repository is not achieved.)
